You will be given a vector of strings. You must sort it alphabetically (case-sensitive, and based on the ASCII values of the chars) and then return the first value.

The returned value must be a string, and have "***" between each of its letters.

You should not remove or add elements from/to the array.

def two_sort(array):
    return '***'.join(min(array))

def two_sort(array):

    return '***'.join(sorted(array)[0])


print(two_sort(["bitcoin", "take", "over", "the", "world", "maybe", "who", "knows", "perhaps"]))
